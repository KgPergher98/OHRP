# OHRP 📈

### Hi, this is the OHRP library where we made our code available for the community to analyze and contribute 🤗

Those codes are here to be tested but also to be extended, remeber tis is an ongoing research and there are lots of things to do to improve OHRP. As so, the reader is invited to enter in contect with me for any contributions and eventually for doubts, issues and further colaboration - This repository only contains free available data and example codes in order to better guide on the usage.

*Datasets and Brazilian Stock Market Composition*: are provided on folder "datasets/", it contains index composition for both the IBOVESPA and the SMALL CAP INDEX as well as the Brazilian Risk Free Rate (SELIC) and a pre-processed matrix of prices.

💻 The following codes are provided:

> *HRP*: Using standard libraries, as proposed by de Prado;

> *RP*: Using standard libraires;

> *EW*: The simpler benchmark.
